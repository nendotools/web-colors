# Web Colors SPA

This is a simple single page app allowing users to generate color palettes based on standard color groupings (e.g. monochromatic, complementary, etc.).

It provides a preview of the chosen palette directly in the UI and offers the raw CSS variables for easy copy-pasting.

In the future, it will support more verbose color options, splitting and expanding color sets, saving, generating templates for other languages/tools, and more.

This is a tinkering project for me to mess around the some infrequent CSS features and also ease some of the hassle I feel in creating color schemes.
